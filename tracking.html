                MIRELIA TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES POLICY


                Effective Date: March 1, 2021

                This tracking technologies policy (the “Policy”) is an integral part of the Terms and Conditions for
                Advertiser(s) (the “Agreement”) and Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”). All the terms used herein are
                used with the same meanings as the Agreement and Privacy Policy provide unless otherwise are directly
                set out hereby.


                CHANGES AND UPDATES TO POLICY

                All changes to this Policy shall be made and published as outlined in article 1 of the Privacy Policy. A
                notification regarding changes may be rendered to you by publishing at Tracking Technologies Policy.


                WHY MIRELIA NETWORKS NEEDS TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

                Like many companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies on the Website (jointly, “cookies”
                unless otherwise stated) including flash local storage and web beacons/GIFs as defined below.

                We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your user experience and obtain data about how
                the Website is being used. There may be some SDK integrated into the Website which may also collect your
                data. These data enable us to develop and optimize the Website and make our Services more relevant for
                you.

                Software Development Kits (“SDK”) are programming packages or libraries of code of one service
                incorporated in a code of another service so those applications could work on or with a specific
                platform of an SDK owner. When your data is collected through SDK, third-party SDK owners can access the
                data as described below. If we use SDK, we will notify you.


                TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

                Cookies are small pieces of code that are stored on your device when you browse and use online services.
                They are installed on your device to enable different useful features, for example, to facilitate
                navigation on the Website. After installed on your device, cookies may be either deleted automatically
                when you close the Website/web browser (session cookies), or stored on your device to facilitate future
                visits to the Website (persistent cookies). Permanent cookies are automatically deleted after a period
                of time set by the cookies’ owner.

                Flash Local storage allows data to be stored locally on your browser or device and includes HTML5 local
                storage and browser cache.

                Web beacon are small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear
                GIFs”) may be included in the Website’s pages and our messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but
                any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web
                beacon. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In
                contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly
                on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

                In some cases, cookies are used to collect data that is recognized to be personal data, such as IP
                addresses and data linked to the IP address. The usage of such cookies is regulated by the data
                protection laws, and you as a user obtain more rights to control the collection and processing of this
                data.

                Providing you with our services, we may use the following cookies: a) essential or strictly necessary
                cookies; b) performance cookies; c) analytical cookies; d) targeting/advertising cookies. These cookies
                may be session or persistent.

                Session cookies are only stored temporarily in the browser’s memory, and are destroyed when it is closed
                down, although they will survive navigating away from the Website they came from. Persistent cookies are
                saved on your computer so that when you close it down and start it up again, it can still be there; they
                are created by giving them an expiry date and when that expiry date is reached, they will be destroyed
                by the computer. If the expiry date is not set then they are automatically session cookies.

                “Essential” or “Strictly Necessary" cookies are strongly required for the error-free operation of the
                website, as well as for its security and accessibility and we also need it to remember your choice about
                cookies. Without them we will not be able to provide you with the Services in a proper way. Despite you
                cannot refuse these cookies through the Website, you may decline them by changing your browser settings,
                but this may affect the Website’s functioning. These cookies are mostly session and expire on closing
                the browser.

                “Performance” cookies collect information about how you use the Website, for instance which pages you go
                to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information
                that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is
                only used to improve how the website works. Generally, these cookies are a mix of session and persistent
                cookies.

                “Analytical” cookies allow us to track your activity on the Website. We may track the number of
                sessions, measure sessions durations, characteristics of their devices, pages you visit, etc. We do so
                to optimize the Website and make it more interesting and useful for you. The data collected in such a
                way is stored in aggregated form, and it does not constitute personally identifiable information.
                Generally, these cookies are a mix of session and persistent cookies.

                “Targeting/Advertising” cookies allow us to show you our advertisements on third-party websites. This
                tool is called “retargeting”. It enables us to provide you with ads based on your previous activity on
                the website. It also enables us to limit how many times you see the respective ads. Generally, these
                cookies are persistent cookies.

                We may use the following cookies:

                Name
                Description
                Type
                Expiration
                Origin
                _hjTLDTest
                When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead
                of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable).
                To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until
                it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed.

                sessions.
